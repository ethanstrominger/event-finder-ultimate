- Trying to do too much at once.  Show commit from Tuesday
- Show the return
- Should have put everything in events - did not put goto
- Annoying when you misspell something it does not always give you an error.
FOr example, call back functions could just be undefined if you mistype.
- Would like to get better at debugging

Command to add a new table:
rails g scaffold Movie title director year:date
rails db:migrate
rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test
null: false

rails g model EventSearch source keyword start_date:date start_time:time end_date:date end_time:time user:references

Examples:
year - spent 45 minutes on it
auto login - 2 - 3.5 hours

Questions:
Whu use def in examples?
Why no has_one_user in controller?
How does valid_params work in test?
